# Hello-World

Hi Foodies!

I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript now so that I can develop my food-related online business. The nature of my business is not established yet, but I envision it to be a community-based and it will provide new platform for current food enthusiasts to collaborate and experiment on new ventures. 

Best,
Nicholas Hong
